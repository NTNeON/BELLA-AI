## 🌟 Core Philosophy

### "AI as Architect"
We're not building a program with integrated AI features, but **a life form driven by AI**. AI is not a tool, but the blueprint for Bella's mind.

### "Companion Relationship"
Bella's design philosophy stems from a warm emotional connection. She is not just a technical product, but a digital companion who can understand, accompany, and grow.

### "Elegance Above All"
From code architecture to user experience, we pursue ultimate elegance. Every line of code is a work of art, every interaction is an expression of emotion.
